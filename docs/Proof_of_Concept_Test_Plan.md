# Toroidal Energy Core Generator  
## Proof of Concept Test Plan

### Objective
Validate the continuous energy generation, durability, and efficiency of the Toroidal Energy Core Generator prototype over a minimum 10-year equivalent operational cycle.

### Test Setup
- Assemble the generator per specifications.
- Connect load simulators: LEDs, small DC motors, and microcontrollers.
- Measure output voltage, current, and power stability.

### Test Procedures
1. **Initial Power-Up**  
   Verify startup functionality and baseline output without load.

2. **Load Testing**  
   Gradually increase loads from low to maximum rated levels, monitor voltage/current.

3. **Stress Testing**  
   Simulate high-impact forces on internal materials to verify energy harvesting efficiency.

4. **Long Duration Cycling**  
   Run continuous operational cycles simulating 10 years of use (accelerated time).

5. **Environmental Testing**  
   Subject device to temperature, humidity, and vibration variations.

### Success Criteria
- Stable energy output within Â±5% variance under rated load.
- No mechanical degradation or material failure.
- Consistent energy harvesting response to physical impacts.
- System self-regulation maintains voltage within safe limits.

### Documentation
Record all test data, anomalies, and maintenance events for review.
