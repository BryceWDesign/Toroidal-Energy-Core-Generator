# Toroidal Energy Core Generator

## Overview

The Toroidal Energy Core Generator (TECG) is a cutting-edge energy harvesting device designed to convert mechanical impact energy into usable electrical power. It leverages advanced materials such as carbon nanotube composites, shear-thickening polymers, and piezoelectric layers, arranged inside a toroidal chamber to maximize energy rebound and conversion efficiency.

This project aims to demonstrate a highly durable, self-sustaining energy generator capable of continuous operation for over 10 years under typical load conditions.

## Build and Installation

### Requirements

- ARM Cortex-M microcontroller or equivalent with ADC and PWM support
- Piezoelectric and composite material components as specified in hardware docs
- Standard embedded development toolchain (e.g., GCC ARM, PlatformIO)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BryceWDesign/Toroidal-Energy-Core-Generator.git
2. Build firmware using PlatformIO or preferred IDE: platformio run

3. Flash firmware to target microcontroller.

4. Assemble hardware per schematics and material guides.

5. Run test harness and monitor outputs.

Testing and Validation
Refer to /docs/Proof_of_Concept_Test_Plan.md for detailed test procedures. Validate continuous output, load response, and durability per test plan.
