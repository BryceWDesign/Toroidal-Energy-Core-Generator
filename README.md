# Toroidal Energy Core Generator

## Overview

The Toroidal Energy Core Generator (TECG) is a cutting-edge energy harvesting device designed to convert mechanical impact energy into usable electrical power. It leverages advanced materials such as carbon nanotube composites, shear-thickening polymers, and piezoelectric layers, arranged inside a toroidal chamber to maximize energy rebound and conversion efficiency.

This project aims to demonstrate a highly durable, self-sustaining energy generator capable of continuous operation for over 10 years under typical load conditions.
